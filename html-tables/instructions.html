<h1>Turning Text into Tables</h1>
<p>
  This exercise involves converting a given skeleton text file into
  an HTML table. The text file contains a list of the top 10 movies
  of all time, according to the top of this list of 
  <a href="http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx">
    AFI's 100 GREATEST AMERICAN MOVIES OF ALL TIME
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  This exercise allows us to practice creating HTML tables. The final
  webpage must meet the following requirements:

  <ul>
    <li>The page title should be, "AFI's Top Ten 10 Greatest American Movies of all Time"</li>
    <li>The page should correctly use table, thead, tbody, tr, th and td tags.</li>
    <li>
      Copy and paste all of your HTML into 
      <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">the W3C HTML validator</a>
      and make sure it validates without errors.
    </li>
  </ul>  
</p>

<p>
  If you finish this exercise early consider doing some optional bonus work.
  Practice creating hyperlink references in anchor tags by creating links from
  each movie to the movies IMDB page or Wikipeia page, or both.
</p>
  
<p>
  Use your own disgression to decide where to place the links. If you only add
  links to one of the pages consider wrapping the movie name in an anchor tag.
  If you add links to both IMDB and Wikipedia pages consider adding two more
  columns to the table.
</p>

<p>
  Download the skeleton file to get started:
  <a href="skeleton.html">skeleton.html</a>
</p>

<p>The final page should look like this:</p>
